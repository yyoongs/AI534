1. Activate python virtual environment in the same directory where the code is.

	source project_name/bin/activate

2. To be able to run this code on the “babylon01” server under the virtual environment, please have these packages installed:
a. Numpy
b. Pandas
c. Matplotlib

One of the way to install packages is to use pip install

ex) 	pip install numpy
	pip install pandas
	pip install matplotlib

If you have problem about pip, please try pip install --upgrade pip

3. Next, to run the program, please use the following command:
	
	python IA3_part1.py

4. Probably, matplot graphs won't be able to show on terminal console. Please check png files in the Zip file or PDF report file.

5. I separated files for each part. And, in part2, I split files into efficient ones and not efficient ones. An efficient one contains calculating run time.
